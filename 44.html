<h2>Info</h2>  
<p><strong><u>DDDD</u></strong></a>is an online platform that is exploring the methodology behind exhibition and distribution of artworks in the digital space. Distribution is not limited to buying and selling – it means the whole process that an artwork is exhibited, enjoyed, sold and archived on the internet. The platform comprises Online Exhibition, Collection, and Texts. Through the Online Exhibition we investigate how artworks that are anchored in non-physical ground are displayed and appreciated online. We archive past exhibitions on Collection and sell the displayed artworks in digital file formats. In the Texts we publish essays, reviews, and interviews by art professionals as well as by people working in adjacent sectors.</p><br><strong>DDDD</strong>는 온라인 공간에서 전시와 작품 유통에 관한 방법론을 지속적으로 탐구하는 플랫폼이다. 여기서 유통이란 단순히 매매를 목적으로 재화를 주고 받는 것이 아닌 인터넷 공간에서 작품이 전시/향유/판매/아카이빙 되는 전 과정으로 정의한다. 플랫폼은 ‘온라인 전시’, ‘컬렉션’, ‘텍스트’로 구성된다. ‘온라인 전시’는 비/물질적인 지지체에 기반한 작품들이 어떻게 인터넷 환경에서 전시되고 향유되는지 살펴본다. ‘D콜렉션’의 경우, 지난 전시를 아카이빙하고, 나아가 전시된 작품을 파일 형태로 판매한다.  ‘텍스트'는 미술을 둘러싼 다양한 분야의 전문가들이 기고한 에세이, 크리틱, 리뷰, 인터뷰 등을 발행한다.</p><br>
